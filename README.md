# TrueVote / EVote : Digital Voting System

TrueVote is a secure, user-friendly digital voting application, built upon evote system simulation with C++/Qt and cryptographic primitives to modernize and safeguard small-scale elections while making it remote ie location independent. It emphasizes integrity, privacy, and auditability by combining SHA-256 password hashing, file-based data storage, and a simple graphical user interface. Currently avaialble as a e-vote s/m simulation.
